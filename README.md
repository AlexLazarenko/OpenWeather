## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `home.MyApplication` class from your IDE.

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
This application is using scheduled task with `@Scheduled(cron=". . .")` annotation to periodically makes requests and saves responses to a MongoDB cloud. Cron expression defines how often scheduled task run. You can change  cron expression in the `config.properties` file. There is https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{spring_version}/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html[`@Scheduled(cron=". . .")` expressions for more sophisticated task scheduling].
